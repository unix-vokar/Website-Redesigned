        <h1 style="color: #CCC;">Analog photography and its role in scientific activity</h1>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;font-family: Helvetica, Ubuntu;">The scientific activity of an applied scientist is very closely related to photography, because all new research requires irrefutable proof, and one of the main proofs is analog photographs taken in various parts of the world.<br><br>
        Our work includes research, scientific and applied parts. We work in an integrated manner. In scientific expeditions, which we regularly conduct for more than five years, we investigate the power of people on earth at different periods of history, as well as the mechanisms by which these people came to power. We study why they were rulers, how they ruled their people, why the peoples were forced or wished to obey these rulers, why they erected numerous structures. But most importantly, we research the technologies they used to come to power and not lose it later.
        The entire research system, as a rule, is divided into certain blocks: a military block, a technological or administrative block, and a mystical block. The complete picture can be obtained by exploring only all 3 blocks.<br><br>

        We are engaged in the study of the present and the past, which allows us to understand how this knowledge was transformed over time, what actions people performed, what scientific works they created, what concepts and priorities existed at one time or another. And also how each person was educated and prepared for the life in which he lived. That allowed a person to stay alive and live at least some kind of life, because in the Middle Ages, human life had a completely different value than it has today, and we know this perfectly well from classical history.
        We solve all these questions, then we turn them into working systems, test them in the so-called laboratory conditions, and then apply them in life.</p>
